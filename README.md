hoverfree 
=========

Fork of hoverzoom.net -- this Chrome extension will show an image if you hover its thumbnail or a link.

Read why here: https://gist.github.com/ralph-tice/5087704 or see http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/19oy0s/hoverzoom_has_gone_evil_tracking_browsing_history/ for discussion.


Philosophy:
===========

HoverFree will be free to use and help people preview a linked image.

HoverFree will never inject advertising, referral links, adware, spyware, etc.

HoverFree will never track or record browsing activity.

Installation:
=============

Installation via the Chrome Web Store has been disabled by the original author. 

For manual installation, either download https://github.com/miketanderson/hoverfree/archive/master.zip

Or clone the git repo:
```
git archive --format zip --output ~/hoverfree.zip master 
```

From the Extensions page in Chrome (chrome://extensions/), enable "Developer Mode" via the check box on the top right.  Click the "Load Unpacked Extension..." button and open the saved zip file.
